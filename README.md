# Playlist tool for Spotify

The playlist tool gives you powerful options that are not included in the Spotify apps.

## Features

- [x] Remove songs one by one
- [x] Replace remixes, covers, acoustic, instrumental and karaoke by the original song
- [ ] Improved playlist shuffle

## Why?

When switching music streaming service, I used a tool to move my playlists to Spotify. I noticed that a lot of the 
songs in the converted playlist were a remixed version, cover or instrumental instead of the original. That's why
I created this tool, to fix those issues and more.
