## Why I created this

When switching music streaming service, I used an app to move my playlists to Spotify. I noticed that a lot of the 
songs in the converted playlist were a remixed, cover, instrumental... version instead of the original.

This app is meant to fix those issues and also add some extra handy functionality.
